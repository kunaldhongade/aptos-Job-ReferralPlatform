### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    sys_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "2abb1ab290cb828323bf6da71a3f36011d59cd7aa576474f19dbcae50521e056"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init

## üõ† How to Use the Platform

### 1. Connect Wallet

- Upon opening the app, click **"Connect Wallet"** to link your Aptos wallet (e.g., **Petra Wallet**).

### 2. Browse Jobs

- Go to the **Jobs** section to view available job listings.
- Each job displays details, including:
  - **Title** and **description**
  - **Finder‚Äôs fee** in APT
  - **Posting date** and **employer details**

### 3. Refer a Candidate

- Select a job listing that matches the candidate's profile.

- Submit the referral, which will be securely recorded on the blockchain for the employer‚Äôs review.

### 4. Confirm a Hire (Employers Only)

- Navigate to **Manage Jobs** to view posted jobs and their referrals.
- Review candidate referrals and confirm a hire.
- Once confirmed, the finder‚Äôs fee will be automatically transferred to the referrer‚Äôs wallet.

## üåê Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Wallet Connection Issues**: Ensure the Aptos wallet extension (e.g., Petra Wallet) is installed and active.
2. **RPC Rate Limits**: Use private RPC providers like **Alchemy** or **QuickNode** to avoid rate limits.
3. **Transaction Errors**: Verify that your wallet has enough balance and permissions for the operation.

## üöÄ Scaling and Deployment

If deploying to **Vercel**, consider these optimizations:

- Use **third-party RPC providers** (e.g., **Alchemy**, **QuickNode**) for reliable blockchain interaction.
- Implement **request throttling** to manage RPC load and avoid rate limits.
- Use **WebSockets** for real-time updates on job status and referral confirmations.
